# Notes for latex compilation with what I already had

I already did some tests with compiling latex files from the command line.

For that, I installed MikTex, from some minor research I did. From sth
I saw now, maybe the best option for MacOS is MacTex, but I'll continue
with MikTex for now, as the I already have it.

Some cli tools are already installed, like `pdfLatex` and `bibtex`, though
I'm not sure if those are all, or where the libraries are installed.

I see now that MikTex is specially used for windows (damn?). And the
ecosystem is not that clear on which one to use, though some are promplty
shown in `https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Choosing_a_LaTeX_Compiler`.

I was searching more a simple command line set of tools, which I could use
consiously for the compilation and library management, but I think I will
not scape from GUI stuff for now.

Now I will try to set up a simple document to compile with the distro
I have, understand the workflows of the distro, and then, continue with
this tutorial/revision for latex `https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Free_online_introduction_to_LaTeX_(part_1)`.
To go over a review of how it works (as I didn't use it for quite some time)
now.
