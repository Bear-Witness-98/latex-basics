I already did some tests with compiling latex files from the command line.

For that, I installed MikTex, from some minor research I did. From sth
I saw now, maybe the best option for MacOS is MacTex, but I'll continue
with MikTex for now, as the I already have it.

Some cli tools are already installed, like `pdfLatex` and `bibtex`, though
I'm not sure if those are all, or where the libraries are installed.
